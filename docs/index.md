My name is Bruce Charron, I've worn a few hats over my career. This blog primarily focuses on technology, but it also reflects my passions for photography and cooking, so you'll find a mix of those topics here too. Recently, Iâ€™ve been enhancing my professional expertise through homelab projects, broadening my skill set and exploring new challenges.
