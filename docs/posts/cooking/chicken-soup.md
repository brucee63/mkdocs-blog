# Chicken Soup
Mom's recipe with option for rice or pasta

<!-- more -->
This is a simple chicken soup recipe from scratch. My mom's recipe calls for rice, but I like it with rotini pasta as well. It freezes well and does the trick in the wintertime. They key to the recipe is the end of the cook, to make sure the carrots, rice or pasta aren't overdone.

## Ingredients
 - Whole Chicken (roaster)
 - 2-3 cups of carrots
 - 2-3 cups of celery
 - 1 cup of rice (short grain if possible for white rice) or 1/2 box rotini pasta
 - 2 white onions
 - 64+ ounces of chicken stock or water and 2 tablespoons of chicken base
 - salt (to taste)
 - pepper (to taste)

## Directions
Chop the onions and celery. Prepare your stock (if not using premade).

Remove the innerds of the bird. Rinse the bird, place in a large sauce pot (12-16 Quarts). Add the onions and celery, add enough stock to almost fully cover the bird.

Bring temperature up and then reduce to low to low-medium and let simmer for 1 hour - 1h 15m. Make sure to turn the bird over every 15-20 minutes so it cooks evenly.

Chop the carrots during this time, be sure that carrots aren't too thickly cut 1/8 - 1/4". Set aside.

Remove the bird, let sit for 10 minutes on a large cutting board. Put on some nitrile gloves and carve the bird. Taking the meat down to bite site pieces (mostly by hand, picking it apart). Add the chicken back to the pot. It you used a large bird, you can set a breast aside.

***If using Pasta (for the starch) -
Cook the pasta in a separate pan, add salt and olive oil. Do not overcook, it's best to sample the pasta near the end of the cook to get the proper firmness. Cook to al dente firmness. Wrinse with cold water, cover and and set aside so it doesn't stick together.

Add the remainder of the stock to the soup. Raise the temperature to medium, add the carrots. Cook for ~20 minutes, the carrots should still be somewhat firm.

***If using Rice (for the starch) - 
Add the rice to the soup, don't overcook the rice. Test, when the rice is done, your carrots should be as well.

Add salt and pepper to taste.

***If using Pasta -
If using pasta, I prefer to keep the pasta separate. Spoon it into the bowl and add the soup over the top. This is to keep the pasta from being overcooked. But you could also add the pasta into the soup when you remove it from heat (if you want to keep it together).

For serving, make sure you get enough chicken, onions, celery and rice/pasta in the bowl, then top off with broth and add some cracked pepper.

Best served with a slice of french bread and butter.
