# About Me

My name is Bruce Charron, I've been a developer, lead, development manager, and a consultant. This blog is primarily about tech, but my other passions are photgraphy and cooking. So you'll find some of that here as well. Of late, I've been augmenting professional experience with homelab work to cover the bases.
