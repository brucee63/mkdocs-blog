# B's Charro Beans 
My take on a classic Mexican side dish, when refried beans just won't do.

<!-- more -->
Charro beans are a classic Mexican side dish, combining pinto beans with oven-baked thick-cut bacon and a medley of vegetables, including tomatoes, poblano, bell, and jalapeño peppers. The dish is seasoned with a blend of cumin, oregano, garlic, onion powder, and cilantro, simmered in a rich chicken stock base. The slow-cooked beans are enhanced with fresh lime juice and topped with cilantro just before serving for a zesty finish. Adjust spice levels to taste, this versatile recipe is a deliciously customizable crowd-pleaser.

## Ingredients
 - 1 lb thick cut bacon
 - 6 - 16oz cans of pinto beans
 - 2 tomatoes
 - 3-4 poblano peppers
 - 1 green bell pepper
 - 2 jalapeno peppers
 - 2 white onions
 - 4-6 cloves of garlic
 - ~64 oz of chicken stock
 - 1 lime

 Spices

 - 2 tablespoons cumin
 - 1 teaspoon onion powder
 - 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
 - 1 teaspoon oregano
 - 1 teaspoon cilantro (add more if using fresh herb)
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## Directions
Bake the bacon in the oven, 350 degrees. Usually takes ~45 minutes, drain/dry the bacon and then chop it, set aside.

Dice the onions, peppers, and tomatoes, keep separated.
If you devein the jalapenos and discard the seeds, the soup won't be as spicy. Your choice.
Mince the garlic cloves.
 
In a large pot, add 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil (in a hot pan), sauté the onions, then add the peppers and sauté, then add the garlic and sauté for a few minutes more. Add bacon, mix. 

Add the tomatoes, then mix in the herbs and spices (all except cilantro). Then add about half the chicken stock and bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.

Then add the beans, and the remaining chicken stock and set to a low simmer for 1-2 hours. Add additional salt or pepper to taste (if necessary). You can also add more chicken stock or water to get the consistency you like.

Before serving add the juice from the lime to the soup and top off with the chopped cilantro.

If the soup needs to be spicier at the end of the cook, you can add red pepper flake, cayenne pepper (sparingly), or hot sauce.
